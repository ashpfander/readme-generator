  ![License badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT_License-blue)

  ## Description

  For this project, we were tasked with creating a README generator using the command-line using node. We were given some starter code. I had to create questions, install the inquirer package, grab the fs (file system) module, and create the README markdown file. Here was the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.

  ## Installation

  Once this repo has been cloned to your local system and opened in VS Code, you will need to install the inquirer package. In your terminal, run `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` and it will install the necessary packages. Then still in your terminal, run `node index.js` to generate the questions and answer them.

  ## Usage

  To quickly and easily create a README for any project.
